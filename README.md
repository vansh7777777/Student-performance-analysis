Student Performance Analyzer
📌 Project Overview
This project aims to analyze students' academic performance using data analytics techniques. The goal is to uncover insights, trends, and factors that influence performance, and optionally build a predictive model to estimate future outcomes.

🎯 Objectives
Identify key factors that affect student academic outcomes.

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to find hidden patterns.

Clean and preprocess the dataset for modeling.

Build and evaluate a simple machine learning model (if applicable).

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn (optional, for modeling)

🧹 Data Preprocessing
Handled missing values and duplicates.

Normalized/encoded categorical values if needed.

Ensured all data types were suitable for analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyzed distributions of marks, attendance, and other features.

Explored relationships between gender, study time, health, and performance.

Used visualizations like bar plots, box plots, and heatmaps.



✅ Results
Found that [insert insight like: "study time and parental education had strong correlation with performance"].

The predictive model achieved an accuracy of XX%.
